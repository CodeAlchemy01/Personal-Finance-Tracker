**My Contributions**  
As a Kotlin (Android Native) developer, I contributed to this personal finance management application by enhancing its core features using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I improved the UI/UX based on Material3 guidelines to ensure a seamless experience. I integrated key libraries like Hilt for dependency injection and Kotlin Flow for reactive data handling. Additionally, I helped optimize the app's performance with Kotlin Coroutines for concurrency. I worked on unit testing using JUnit and Kotest to ensure the appâ€™s stability. Lastly, I contributed to the app's persistence layer using Room DB and DataStore for efficient data management.
